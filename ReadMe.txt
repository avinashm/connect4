About Project:
Connect Four (also known as Captain's Mistress, Four Up, Plot
Four, Find Four, Fourplay, Four in a Row and Four in a Line) is a
two-player game in which the players first choose a colour and
then take turns dropping coloured discs from the top into a
seven-column, six-row vertically-suspended grid. The pieces fall
straight down, occupying the next available space within the
column. The object of the game is to connect four of one's own
discs of the same colour next to each other vertically,
horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent.

Instructions:


You can play the game either in 1 player or two player mode. To
make a move you need to click in the respective column of the
6x7 grid. The disc will appear in the lowest unoccupied position
in the column. The first player has red colored discs and the
second player has blue discs. If at any time of the game four
discs of the same colour come in a line (vertically, horizontally,
or diagonally), then that player has won the game. If all
positions are filled and no one has won then the game is drawn.
The result of the game is printed on the bottom of the canvas.
